    <p> Bitwsie has been a huge blessing, if your interested in the tech industry, then their really isnt a better start. Bitwsie has expanded beyond a small company and has now entered a new realm of awesomeness. I love their classes, I have learned so much in such a short amount of time and am excited to continue learning the ins and out of computer coding. I feel truly blessed to be a part of this, it has truly changed my life. </p>
